# Complete API Integration Guide

Your Henvid platform now has **seamless integration** between all backend APIs and frontend components. The existing UI remains exactly the same while being powered by real functionality.

## 🚀 What's Been Implemented

### Authentication System
- **Real login/logout**: Form validation, JWT sessions, device tracking
- **User registration**: Company creation with complete validation
- **Session management**: Automatic redirects, protected routes
- **User context**: Available throughout the app via `useAuth()`

### User Management
- **Create User modal**: Real user creation with validation
- **User listing**: Paginated user management (ready for dashboard)
- **Role management**: Admin/user permissions
- **Company integration**: Users automatically associated with their company

### Payment System
- **PaymentHistory component**: Real payment data from API
- **Dynamic pagination**: Functional page navigation
- **Status indicators**: Real payment status with proper colors
- **Currency formatting**: Proper Norwegian kroner display

### API Infrastructure
- **Comprehensive API client**: All endpoints covered in `utils/api.ts`
- **Error handling**: Consistent error messages and user feedback
- **Data formatting**: Currency, dates, and user-friendly displays
- **Authentication headers**: Automatic JWT token management

## 🔧 How to Test

### 1. Authentication Flow
```bash
# Start the application
npm run dev

# Visit http://localhost:3000/register
# Fill out registration form with real data
# Check MongoDB for new company and user records

# Visit http://localhost:3000/login
# Use created credentials
# Should redirect to dashboard
```

### 2. User Management
```bash
# After login, navigate to user management section
# Click "Create User" button
# Fill form and submit
# Check MongoDB users collection for new record
# User should appear in UI immediately
```

### 3. Payment History
```bash
# Navigate to billing/payment history section
# Should load real payment data from database
# Test pagination if you have multiple payments
# Add test payments via API to see real data
```

## 📁 Integration Architecture

### Frontend Components → Backend APIs
```
🎨 Frontend UI           🔄 API Client           🗄️ Backend
├── Login Form       →   authApi.login       →   /api/auth/login
├── Register Form    →   authApi.register    →   /api/auth/register
├── CreateUser Modal →   userApi.createUser  →   /api/users
├── PaymentHistory   →   paymentApi.get      →   /api/payments
└── Dashboard        →   dashboardApi.get    →   /api/dashboard
```

### Key Integration Points

#### 1. Authentication Context (`utils/auth-context.tsx`)
```typescript
const { user, login, logout, loading } = useAuth();
// Available in all components
// Handles automatic redirects
// Manages JWT tokens
```

#### 2. API Client (`utils/api.ts`)
```typescript
// Centralized API calls with consistent error handling
authApi.login(email, password)
userApi.createUser(userData)
paymentApi.getPayments(filters)
// All return standardized response format
```

#### 3. Real-time UI Updates
- Forms show loading states during API calls
- Success/error messages appear automatically
- Data refreshes after successful operations
- Pagination works with real data

## 🔄 Data Flow Examples

### User Registration
1. User fills registration form
2. Form validates required fields
3. API call creates company + user
4. Success redirects to login
5. User can immediately login

### Payment History Loading
1. Component mounts
2. Fetches user's company payments
3. Displays in table with real status colors
4. Pagination controls work with API
5. Loading states during fetch

### User Creation
1. Admin clicks "Create User"
2. Modal opens with form
3. Form validates email/names
4. API creates user in same company
5. Success closes modal
6. User list refreshes automatically

## 🎯 Next Steps for Testing

### 1. Create Test Data
```javascript
// You can use MongoDB Compass or API calls to create test data
// Or use the registration form to create multiple companies
```

### 2. Test All Flows
- [ ] Register new company
- [ ] Login with created account  
- [ ] Create additional users
- [ ] View payment history
- [ ] Test logout functionality
- [ ] Test authentication redirects

### 3. Check Database
```bash
# Connect to MongoDB and verify:
# - Companies collection has your company
# - Users collection has your users
# - Payments collection (if you add test payments)
# - Sessions collection tracks login sessions
```
